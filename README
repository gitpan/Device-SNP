This Device::SNP module contains an implementation of the GE Fanuc SNP-X
serial protocol as used by GE Fanuc DataPanel data terminals.  See
http://www.gefanuc.com/en/ProductServices/VisPCSolutions/DataPanel/index.html

DataPanels are usually used with PLCs to monitor and control industrial
equipment. They provide a programmable bitmap display, programmable function
keys, and can poll and display data values and set data values in a remote PLC
using the SNP-X serial protocol.

The Device::SNP object implements an SNP-X slave, opens a Device::Serial port
and answers SNP-X requests to read and write data to a simulated PLC.

This package also contains a sample application that uses a DataPanel 160 to
implement a remote control panel for the Amarok music player on Linux,
allowing you to play, pause, next, prev tracks etc.

DataPanels are programmed with a GE application called DataDesigner,
avaialable from the GE web site for registered customers. Included in this
package is a database for DataDesigner 5.2 for the Amarok remote control
application. You will need DataDesigner 5.2 to download the
datadesigner/linux.DTB database to the DataPanel 160

Tested on SuSE linux, but should run on pretty well any Linux or Unix.
